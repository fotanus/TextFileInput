TextFileInput
=============

Simple CoffeeScript code to transform input file in texts. It was written using coffeescript, but you can include the generated javascript without needing coffeescript.

To use it, simply include the .js file in the page with input files. The folder example shows the functionality without any stylesheet.

you will be able to customize your file inputs with the following classes:
* **.custom-file-input:** A wrapper for all file input divs
* **.custom-file-input .file-input-button:** The file input button, that is pressed to change the included file
* **.custom-file-input .file-name:** The name of the file that will be uploaded. This div appears only after a file is choosed.

Also, you can change the "Choose a file" words by modifying the js code - it is one of the first lines.
